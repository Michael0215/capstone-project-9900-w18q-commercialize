I used a third-party extension named Algolia to implement the searching function and it works fine on 
an emulator on Windows. But it crashes when I test it on VM using the Anbox emulator.
This is probably because the version of Android of Anbox is too old. Need to find a 
substitution for Algolia.

The window size of the emulator on VM is not what we see on Windows, thus some issues displaying
pages of the APP appears when I test it on VM. I need to search for some commands to set a proper
size for emulator on VM, and keep test APP on it to find bugs. Then I should fix them.

Fix some bugs and write the user manaul for the report. It is a little tedious to establish
